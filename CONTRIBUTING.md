Contributions to Patience Deck are welcome. However, please take the
time to read this document first.

If you have a question, Github issues is not the right place for that.
You may send your question to [Openrepos page of Patience
Deck](https://openrepos.net/content/tomin/patience-deck) or directly to
me via email. I will do my best to reply to you.

If you want to report a bug, please consider the following:
- If it's an outright crash or the game is losing cards, then please
  file an issue to Github issues. Remember to include all relevant
  details about reproducing the issue. Bugs in supported games take
  priority over bugs in experimental games.
- If it's deviation of behaviour from GNOME Aisleriot, then it is likely
  a bug. If game behaves in a way you would not expect but it also
  happens in GNOME Aisleriot, then that's not a bug in Patience Deck but
  should be reported to [GNOME Aisleriot
  gitlab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/aisleriot/-/issues) instead.
- If you would like to see a certain game being enabled in Patience Deck
  by default, please test it throughly with the current version or
  master branch and write a report to Github issues describing also
  potential problems with the game. Please check that there is no
  existing report about the game already in Github. Every now and then
  Patience Deck enables new games to be played and yours may very well
  be included the next time.
- If it's a new feature, feel free to suggest it but please first check
  if someone else has suggested the same or similar feature.

If you would like to contiribute code, please consider the following:
- If you want to fix something small, you may create a pull request in
  Github. I will read it through when I have time and comment if I
  disagree with something.
- If you want to make a bigger fix that might affect behaviour, please
  file an issue report first or comment existing one. That allows
  discussing the right fix for the issue. You may then implement the
  fix. This is done to save both your and my time. Please, mention that
  you would like to implement the fix yourself.
- If you want to implement a new feature, please file an issue report
  first to suggest that enhancement. Please, mention that you would like
  to implement it yourself.

If you have any questions that weren't answered here, feel free to ask.
I'm best reached over email (for example tomi (plus) patience-deck (at)
tomin (dot) site) or through [Patience Deck Openrepos
page](https://openrepos.net/content/tomin/patience-deck) which I
frequently visit.
